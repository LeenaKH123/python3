1. ) Abstraction : create a black box when writing your code, users dont need to know about all the details of the implementation
python's base unit of abstraction is the class.

2. ) Encapsulation: bind the data and the code that changes it together, to keep the data safe from unintentional changes.
exposing public interface and hiding everything else in a private interface.

3. ) Inheritance: allows an object to access the properties of its parent object.


4. ) Polymorphism:  gives the possibility for different classes to implement the same attributes and methods, but handle their logic differently.
